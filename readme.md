## Developer Comment

Hello everyone, and welcome back to my Repo! My name is Abdulhakeem Dahir and I am an aspiring Software Developer. This week I have been tasked to make a Work Day Scheduler Application. This was not an easy assignment as you need to convert your knowledge of Javascript into jQuery. Any feedback is welcome! Thank you!
